# Neural Network

## About
A basic OOP implementation of a neural network for the recognition of handwritten digits. This was made to get a better understanding of how convolutional neural networks work "under the hood". 

### A Note Regarding the Convolutional and Pooling layer scripts:
*They were created while I was exploring how convolutional and pooling layers could be coded.*

*Unfortunately I didn't find the time to complete the backpropagation for the layers, but I didn't want to lose the work I had done so far, as I intend to finish the project*

*(I also thought these were pretty cool and the way I managed to capture the essence of forward propagation for these layers is something I'm very proud of.)*

**Libraries Used**:
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
